Multi Actor Bank Service Example.

The code can be opened as an eclipse project.

To run the application runs with 3 arguments
n - the maximum number of accounts that will request operations from the bank service
m - number of data locked operations (in sets of 3), each account will perform a set of operations (withdraw, deposit, checkSavings) * this argument
w - the number of active objects inside the Actor also the degree of parallelism.

The application measures the performance on a logarithmic scale starting from one actor, up to the maximum number of actors given by the first argument. and outputs the results in a file:

n_3*m.out


 The application is still under development and any feedback can be sent to vlad.serbanescu@cwi.nl.
